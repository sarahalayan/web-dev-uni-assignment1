        <p>Issam Abdallah and other journalists covered the strikes in Southern Lebanon close to Aalma ech Chaab. A tank-fire hit the group and Abdallah was killed.
            Six other journalists from news agencies, including Reuters, photographer Christina Assi, and video journalist Dylan Collins from Agence France-Presse (AFP),
             as well as a journalist from the broadcaster Al Jazeera, were injured, some seriously. Lebanon's army has said the IDF fired the missile that killed Abdallah.
              Another Reuters reporter at the scene said Abdallah was killed by projectiles fired from the direction of Israel. 
   Abdallah was buried on 14 October 2023 in his hometown of Khiam in southern Lebanon next to his father, who had died a year prior. Journalists placed their
            cameras on the grave to honour his memory.
